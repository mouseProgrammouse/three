# Interactive 3D Graphics Course Homework

This repository contains practical examples for tasks in the ["Interactive 3D Graphics"](https://learn.udacity.com/courses/cs291) Udacity course.
The course covers essential concepts like 3D graphics principles, including meshes, transforms, lighting, 
animation, and building interactive 3D applications that smoothly run in web browsers.

## Prerequisites

Install Node Version Manager (nvm). 
This project uses a specific version of Node.js and npm. To manage the correct version, we recommend using `nvm`.

1. To install `nvm` run the following command:

npm install
```

2. Start the server using live-server:
```
live-server
```


3. Open `localhost:8080` in a web browser to view the project.
